The [Minnesota Department of Natural Resources](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/what_are.html) (MnDNR)
designates areas that contain "natural features of exceptional scientific or educational value" as Scientific &
Natural Areas (SNAs). These areas are meant to protect and preserve undisturbed ecosystems and endangered plant and
animal species, as well as significant geological features. According to MnDNR, SNAs "are public lands open to
recreational activities that do not disturb natural conditions, such as birdwatching, nature photography, and
hiking," though some areas may have restricted access in some parts of the year due to their use as breeding grounds
by various protected animals.

This website provides information about all of Minnesota's SNAs, and also provides detailed information about the
plant species that are found in each SNA.

## Instructions to run:

You'll need to get API keys for [Trefle](https://trefle.io) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com). Set them as environment variables with the names, "TREFLE_TOKEN" and "MAPBOX_TOKEN", respectively.
